# Data Science & Analytics Internship – DevelopersHub

This repository contains the work completed during my Data Science & Analytics internship at DevelopersHub. The internship required finishing at least three tasks. I completed the first three, each focused on a different core area of practical machine learning. All work is done in Python using pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## Tasks Completed

### **1. Dataset Exploration and Visualization**

**Dataset:** Iris
**Focus:** Basic EDA
**Work included:**

* Loaded the dataset and reviewed structure
* Checked columns, head, summary statistics
* Created scatter plots, histograms, box plots
* Looked for patterns and outliers

This task covered the fundamentals: understanding raw data before modeling.

### **2. Credit Risk Prediction**

**Dataset:** Loan Prediction Dataset
**Objective:** Predict the chance of a loan default
**Work included:**

* Cleaned missing data
* Visualized key features (loan amount, education, income)
* Built Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models
* Evaluated accuracy and confusion matrix

This task centered on building a simple but functional binary classifier.

### **3. Customer Churn Prediction**

**Dataset:** Bank Churn Modelling Dataset
**Objective:** Identify customers likely to leave
**Work included:**

* Cleaned and prepared the dataset
* Encoded categorical fields (gender, geography)
* Trained a classification model
* Analyzed feature importance

This task connected prediction with business decisions by showing which factors drive churn.
